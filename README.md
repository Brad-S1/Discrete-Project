# Discrete-Project
Discrete Mathematics Project on Cryptography

## Project Title:
Prime Numbers in Cryptography: A Study and Implementation

## Project Description:
In this project, you'll delve into the world of cryptography, which is a cornerstone of cybersecurity. You will focus on the implementation and analysis of cryptographic algorithms that rely on prime number theoryâ€”a fundamental aspect of discrete mathematics. Prime numbers are crucial to public-key cryptosystems like RSA, which is widely used for secure data transmission.

## Project Objectives:

1. Prime Number Theory Review: Study the significance of prime numbers in cryptography and review algorithms for prime number generation and primality testing.

2. RSA Algorithm Implementation: Implement the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm using a programming language, such as Python, that involves generating large prime numbers and understanding Euler's totient function.

3. Security Analysis: Analyze the security of the implemented RSA algorithm by examining the difficulty of prime factorization for large integers, which is the basis for RSA's security.

4. Performance Evaluation: Test the performance of the RSA algorithm with various key sizes and evaluate the trade-offs between security and computational efficiency.

5. Simpler Cryptosystems: As a comparative study, implement a simpler cryptosystem, such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which also relies on discrete mathematics (specifically the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem).

6. Final Report: Prepare a report discussing the theory behind the implemented algorithms, the process of their implementation, security features, performance metrics, and any potential improvements.

## Key Deliverables:

A functioning implementation of the RSA algorithm and a simpler cryptosystem.
A performance and security analysis report of the implemented algorithms.
A presentation that summarizes the findings and potential applications in real-world scenarios.

## Skills Required:

Basic knowledge of discrete mathematics, especially prime numbers and modular arithmetic.
Programming skills to implement cryptographic algorithms. 
Understanding of basic cybersecurity principles, particularly those related to cryptography.

## Potential Impact:

This project provides a hands-on understanding of how discrete mathematics is applied in the field of cryptography within cybersecurity. By engaging in the implementation and analysis of cryptographic algorithms, you will gain insights into the challenges of securing digital information and the mathematical foundations that enable encryption technologies.

This topic is appropriately scoped for an undergraduate-level project to be completed in a month. It provides a focused yet comprehensive exploration of a discrete mathematics application in cybersecurity, ensuring that the student can engage with both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject matter within the given time frame.
